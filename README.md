# SmallPost

**SmallPost** is a personal project created for my self-study of the **ASP.NET Core** framework.  
It’s a simple blogging platform that allows users to create, edit, and view posts.  
The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of ASP.NET Core architecture.


## Getting started.
1. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone <url>
```
2. Change the project start up to **SmallPost.Web**.

3. Make sure your under **SmallPost.Infrastructure** project and run the following command to build the database.

```bash
Update-Database
```

## Notes.

This project is primarily for learning purpose and may evolve as I explore more features of ASP.NET core.
